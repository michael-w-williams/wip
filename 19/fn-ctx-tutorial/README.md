# Using CLI Variables in your Functions
In addition to the normal variables you use in function creation, Fn allows you to pass configuration data, created with the CLI, into your function.  This data, along with other automatically generated information, is converted into environment variables and are made available to your function's context. This tutorial covers how to set your own configuration variables and how to use them in a function.

## Function Scenario
In this tutorial, you create a `java-cfg-fn` function that displays configuration data passed to the function. For the example, let's use some database information that we might need in a function.

* `DB_HOST_URL` displays the hostname and path to the database.
* `DB_USER` is the user name used to connect to the database.
* `DB_PASSWORD` is the password for our database user.

## What Variable Spaces are Available for my Function?
There are several Fn variable spaces where you put and get data for your function.

* **Application space:** Variables stored in an application are available to all functions that are deployed to that application.
* **Function space:** Variables stored for a function are only available to that function.
* **Default space:** By default, a number of environment variables are automatically generated in an Fn Docker image. The section that follows details the automatically generated variables.

#### Default Space Variables
Here is the list of automatically generated variables in the default space that are available to your functions.

|Fn Generated Var|Sample Value|Description|
|----------------|------------|-----------|
|[FN_APP_ID]|01NNNNNNNNNG8G00GZJ0000001|The application ID for the app the current function is contained in.|
|[FN_FN_ID]|01DYNNNNNNNG8G00GZJ0000002|The ID of the current function|
|[FN_FORMAT]|http-stream|(Deprecated). Communications protocol.|
|[FN_LISTENER]|unix:/tmp/iofs/lsnr.sock|The Unix socket address (prefixed with "unix:") on the file system that the FDK should create to listen for requests. The platform will guarantee that this directory is writable to the function. FDKs must not write any other data than the unix socket to this directory.|
|[FN_MEMORY]|128|The maximum memory of the function in MB.|
|[FN_TYPE]|sync|The type of function. Always `sync` currently.|



### Where to set the Variables
For this tutorial, let's set the `DB_HOST_URL` at the application level and the `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` variables at the function level. That gives us a little practices setting both types of variables.


## Create the Sample Configuration Function.
Ensure you have the Fn server running to host your function.

### Break this up by variables so we can test each part.

(1) Start the server.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn start
```

(2) Create the `cfg-app` for your function.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)

```sh
% fn c a cfg-app
```

(3) Create a boilerplate `java-cfg-fn` function.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn init --runtime java java-cfg-fn
```

(4) Change into the `java-cfg-fn` directory.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% cd java-cfg-fn
```

(5) Remove the `src/test` directory so we don't have to update our tests.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% rm -r src/test
```

(6) Add the the `DB_HOST_URL` variable to `cfg-app`.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn cf a cfg-app DB_HOST_URL //myhost/mydb
```

(7) Verify the value has been added.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn ls cf a cfg-app
KEY	VALUE
DB_HOST_URL	//myhost/mydb
```


(8) Modify the "Hello World!" boiler plate example (located in src -> main -> java -> com -> example -> fn -> HelloFunction.java) as described in the next section.

(9) Deploy and invoke your function locally. (**Note:** You must complete the code changes described in the next section to get the output shown.)

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn -v dp --app cfg-app --local
```

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn iv cfg-app java-cfg-fn
```

Your output should be similar to:
```sh
Hello world!
DB Host URL: //myhost/mydb
DB User: your-db-account
DB Passwd: your-db-password
% fn iv cfg-app java-cfg-fn
```

### Adding the Fn Context to your Function
Update the `HelloFunction` class as shown below. An explanation of the changes follows below.

```Java
package com.example.fn;

import com.fnproject.fn.api.FnConfiguration;
import com.fnproject.fn.api.RuntimeContext;


public class HelloFunction {
	/* Vars for Env Variables */
	private String dbHost;		// DB_HOST
	private String dbUser;		// DB_USER
	private String dbPassword;	// DB_PASSWORD
	
	@FnConfiguration
	public void config(RuntimeContext ctx) {
		
		dbHost = ctx.getConfigurationByKey("DB_HOST_URL").orElse("//localhost/DBName");
		
		dbUser = ctx.getConfigurationByKey("DB_USER").orElse("your-db-account");
				
		dbPassword = ctx.getConfigurationByKey("DB_PASSWORD").orElse("your-db-password");
		
	}
	
    public String handleRequest(String input) {
    	String resultStr = "";
        String name = (input == null || input.isEmpty()) ? "world"  : input;

        resultStr = resultStr + "Hello " + name + "!\n";
        resultStr = resultStr + "DB Host URL: " + dbHost + "\n";
        resultStr = resultStr + "DB User: " + dbUser + "\n";
        resultStr = resultStr + "DB Passwd: " + dbPassword + "\n";
        
        return resultStr;
    }

}
```

First, we import a couple of FDK for Java classes.

```java
import com.fnproject.fn.api.FnConfiguration;
import com.fnproject.fn.api.RuntimeContext;
```

The `com.fnproject.fn.api.FnConfiguration` class allows you to annotate methods to be used for configuration. This allows you to setup and configure variables before the `handleRequest` method is run.

The `com.fnproject.fn.api.RuntimeContext` class gives you access to the environment variables set automatically or created by the Fn CLI. We can pass a `RuntimeContext` variable to a method and gain access to all the available environment variables.


The following method is an example of how the `RuntimeContext` can be passed to a method and used to initialize data.

```java
@FnConfiguration
public void config(RuntimeContext ctx) {
    
    dbHost = ctx.getConfigurationByKey("DB_HOST_URL").orElse("//localhost/DBName");
    
    dbUser = ctx.getConfigurationByKey("DB_USER").orElse("your-db-account");
            
    dbPassword = ctx.getConfigurationByKey("DB_PASSWORD").orElse("your-db-password");
    
}
```

The `config` method uses the `RuntimeContext` to initialize the `dbHost`, `dbUser`, and `dbPassword` variables. String optionals are used to set default variables just in case the variables we are looking for are not set. Similar methods could be created if more configuration is required.

Completing the code changes above produces the output shown above where `DB_HOST_URL` has been set to `//myhost/mydb`.  


## Add the Function Variables and Retest
With our function setup and deployed, let's add some function variables to see if our output changes. Add the `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` variables to your function variable space and re-test your function.

(1) Add the `DB_USER` variable to the `java-cfg-fn` function.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn cf f cfg-app java-cfg-fn DB_USER mydbuser
```

(2) Verify the value has been added.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn ls cf f cfg-app java-cfg-fn
KEY	VALUE
DB_USER	mydbuser
```

(3) Add the `DB_PASSWORD` variable to the `java-cfg-fn` function.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn cf f cfg-app java-cfg-fn DB_PASSWORD mydbpassword
```

(4) Verify the value has been added.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn ls cf f cfg-app java-cfg-fn
KEY		VALUE
DB_PASSWORD	mydbpassword
DB_USER		mydbuser
```

(9) Invoke your function again.

![User input icon](images/userinput.png)
```sh
% fn iv cfg-app java-cfg-fn
```

Your output should be similar to:
```sh
Hello world!
DB Host URL: //myhost/mydb
DB User: mydbuser
DB Passwd: mydbpassword
```

Notice your function immediately picks up and uses the variables. You don't need to redeploy the function or make any other modifications. The variables are picked up and injected into the Docker instance when the function is invoked.

## Summary
You have set variables using the Fn CLI and then accessed them in a Java function using the application context. Fn makes it easy to store configuration data locally and use it in your functions.

For more information see the [configuration vars documentaion page](https://github.com/fnproject/docs/blob/master/fn/develop/configs.md). See also [Function Configuration and Initialization](https://github.com/fnproject/docs/blob/master/fdks/fdk-java/FunctionConfiguration.md) for other examples of how to access the context in a function.
